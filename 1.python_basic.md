# python basic

## feature and related-knowledge
- Specifically for data science
- IPython : shell interface 
- Python script = file end with .py

## python basic variable

#### four basic variable :  FIBS
-  type(variable) :  to print type of data 
- fiur  basic data type : int, float, str(both '' and " " can represent string)  , bool

#### basic variable operation
- int operation : intuitive operation 
- float operation :intuitive operation 
- str operation(only add and minus) : concatenate two string [at the end] / remove part of string [at the end]
- bool operation :intuitive operation 

## python advanced variable

#### advanced variable - list
- list [] , list can contain any datatype (FIBS)
#### subset the list
- zero-based indexing
- [ start : end ] inclusive/exclusive
#### manipulate the list
- change: assign new value : list[0] = 5
- two list addition (use +) : list + [a,b] will add a and b in the end of list
- remove elements : del(list[index])

#### assign new value to new varible
```
x = ['a','b','c']
y = x // it means that y is a variable point to the address of 'a'

if we let y[1] = 'z'
y = ['a','z','c'] // since y points to the address of 'a', which means it points to the array(list) of x , so if y's value is changed, list x's value is gonna be changeed as well
x = ['a','z','c']

x = ['a','b','c']
y = list(x) // it means it only copies the value of list x, not address

if we let y[1] = 'z'
y = ['a','z','c']
x = ['a','b','c'] // change in y doesn't affect list x
```
